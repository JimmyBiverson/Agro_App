# Farmmantra Requirements Status

Audited against the June 2026 requirements document on 20 August 2026.

## Implemented

- Laravel REST API, Flutter Android app, and responsive web dashboard are present.
- Role-based access exists for Franchise Partner, Farmmantra Staff, Finance Department, and System Administrator.
- Product categories, SKUs, standard prices, price slabs, user management, password reset, and franchise management are available.
- Franchise order placement, staff approval/decline/adjustment, expected delivery dates, delivery confirmation, and order status notifications are implemented.
- Stock receipt verification supports per-item quantities and discrepancy notes. Confirmation is transactional and requires every receipt item to be reconciled.
- Customer records, sales, sale history, stock deductions, inventory valuation, inventory movements, and low-stock calculations are implemented.
- Payment submission, proof upload, finance verification, acceptance, rejection, information requests, balances, and payment history are implemented. Verified amounts are capped at the submitted amount and acceptance is transactional.
- Chat history, support tickets, persisted notifications, admin conversation replies, and chat access scoping are implemented.
- Admin, staff, finance, and franchise dashboards exist. Sales, payment, inventory, and order reports are available through the API; web CSV exports are available.
- Activity logs, Sanctum authentication, bcrypt password hashing, API role middleware, and login throttling are implemented.
- Flutter supports responsive layouts and is no longer locked to portrait orientation.

## Partial

- Mobile chat currently refreshes by polling. The backend broadcasts events and sends FCM notifications, but the Flutter app does not yet include a Firebase/WebSocket client for foreground, background, or terminated-app real-time delivery.
- Product and price synchronization is API-based. A persistent mobile sync/cache strategy and push-based master-data invalidation are not implemented.
- Reports are JSON API responses and web CSV exports; Excel/PDF export and scheduled email distribution are not implemented.
- Audit logging exists for major order/payment actions, but it is not yet guaranteed for every admin, profile, password, and configuration mutation.
- Android release configuration still needs the production application ID, signing credentials, Firebase configuration, and store metadata.
- Two-factor authentication, database-at-rest encryption, penetration testing, retention policy automation, and disaster-recovery procedures require deployment and operations work.

## Validation

- Laravel: 17 tests passing, 116 assertions.
- Flutter analyzer: no errors; five existing style/deprecation infos remain.
- The latest implementation changes are published on the `main` branch of `JimmyBiverson/Agro_App`.

## Deployment Actions Still Required

1. Run `php artisan migrate` in `agro_web` for the admin chat reply reference migration.
2. Configure production TLS, database backups, storage protection, Firebase/FCM credentials, and Android release signing.
3. Decide whether real-time mobile delivery will use Firebase Cloud Messaging plus polling fallback or a WebSocket client, then complete the corresponding Flutter integration.
4. Add Excel/PDF generation, scheduled reports, and the remaining audit/security operations before claiming full production compliance.
